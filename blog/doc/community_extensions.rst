Community Extensions
====================

Community extensions are Tinkerer extensions contributed and maintained by
various authors. They are not part of the Tinkerer distribution, but they can
be acquired separately from the
`tinkerer-contrib respository <https://bitbucket.org/vladris/tinkerer-contrib>`_.

Extensions usually go in your blog's ``_exts`` directory. Additional setup
steps are provided for each extension.
