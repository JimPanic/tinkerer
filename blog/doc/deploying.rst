Deploying
=========

Tinkerer generates a static website under ``blog/html``. The files can be 
uploaded anywhere. An option is to host your blog on `Bitbucket 
<http://www.bitbucket.org>`_.

Hosting on Bitbucket
--------------------

Create a repository named ``$(USERNAME).bitbucket.org`` where ``$(USERNAME)``
is your Bitbucket username, for example ``johndoe.bitbucket.org``. If you
create such a repository, when accessing ``http://johndoe.bitbucket.org``, 
Bitbucket will automatically serve the ``index.html`` found under the root
of the repository. You have two options:

Upload HTML only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commit the content of your blog's ``blog/html`` directory to the repository.
The ``index.html`` file generated by Tinkerer is the front page of your blog.

.. note::
    Make sure to update the ``website`` variable in ``conf.py`` to
    ``http://johndoe.bitbucket.org/`` so the RSS feed can properly link your
    posts.

Upload both HTML and sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commit your whole blog to the repository, including files in the root directory
and source. Tinkerer generates an ``index.html`` file in the blog's root which 
redirects to ``blog/html/index.html`` to enable this scenario.

.. note::
    Make sure to update the ``website`` variable in ``conf.py`` to
    ``http://johndoe.bitbucket.org/blog/html/`` so the RSS feed can properly 
    link your posts. Note the trailing ``blog/html`` - the website variable 
    must point to the root of your blog's *build* directory, not root 
    directory.
